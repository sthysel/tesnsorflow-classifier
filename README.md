# Old tensorflow API based classifier 

Object detection and classification, fork of Dat Tran's object_detect_app repo cleaned up and modernised.
Used as baseline for current Keras based models.


## Install notes

Tensorflow wheels do not support Python 3.7. Arch has tensorflow packages but I
prefer having all in a virtualenv.
